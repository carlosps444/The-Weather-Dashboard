# The-Weather-Dashboard


//This is The Weather Dashboard. For this challenge, we had to make a weather dashboard that shows the five day forecast and that shows the weather for anywhere in the world. I really wanted to be creative and show a lot of color. It was a pretty challenging assignment. But throughout the process, I felt like i've improved in a lot aspects. One thing I wasn't able to do was the history section. But overtime, I'll know how to.
